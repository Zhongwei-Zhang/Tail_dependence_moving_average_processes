This repository contains the code to conduct simulation studies of type-G Matérn SPDE fields and compute the tail dependence coefficients of more general moving average processes. 
It also contains the code to reproduce the plots in the paper entitled ``Tail dependence coefficients of moving average processes driven by exponential-tailed Lévy noise''.
